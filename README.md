Welcome to the official repository for **KG-TRACES**! 🚀 We're enhancing Large Language Models to reason with **explainable**, **accuracy**, and **traceability** by leveraging the power of Knowledge Graphs.

## 🎯 The Challenge: LLMs Lost in Thought?

Vanilla LLMs are amazing, but when it comes to complex, multi-hop reasoning, they can sometimes...
*   🤯 Hallucinate facts
*   ❓ Provide answers without clear justification
*   🚧 Hit a wall in scenarios demanding trustworthy, step-by-step explanations

This limits their use in critical domains. That's where **KG-TRACES** steps in!

## 💡 Our Solution: KG-TRACES

KG-TRACES is a novel framework that explicitly teaches LLMs *how* to reason by supervising their internal "thought process" with knowledge graphs guidance. We guide them to:

1.  🗺️ **Chart the Course**: Predict symbolic **knowledge graph reasoning paths** from question to answer.
2.  📝 **Show Their Work**: Generate **attribution-aware reasoning explanations**, clearly claim whether each step comes from the KG or the LLM's internal knowledge 🧠, and how effective it was!

## 🌟 Why KG-TRACES Rocks

*   🔍 **Crystal-Clear Explanations**: Understand *why* the LLM reached its conclusion.
*   🛡️ **Trustworthy & Attributable**: Know the evidence source of each reasoning step.
*   💪 **Robust Performance**: Excels even with limited or no direct KG access during inference.
*   🌍 **Versatile**: Shows strong generalization to specialized fields like medicine.

## 🛠️ Get Started with KG-TRACES

Ready to dive in? Here's how:

### 1. Prerequisites

Make sure you have:
*   Python 3.12+
*   PyTorch 2.60+
*   🤗 Transformers & Datasets
*   deepspeed 0.16+

### 2. Installation

#### Set up environment:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Edaizi/KG-TRACES.git
cd KG-TRACES
conda create -n kg_traces python=3.12
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


#### 📚 Datasets: The Fuel for KG-TRACES
We've meticulously prepared augmented SFT datasets for WebQSP and CWQ, packed with reasoning paths and augmented reasoning process with source attributions. Find them on Hugging Face:

- [KG-TRACES-WebQSP](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Edaizi/KG-TRACES-WebQSP)
- [KG-TRACES-CWQ](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Edaizi/KG-TRACES-CWQ)


Using the Datasets:
```python
from datasets import load_dataset

webqsp_sft_data = load_dataset("Edaizi/KG-TRACES-WebQSP")
cwq_sft_data = load_dataset("Edaizi/KG-TRACES-CWQ")

print("Example WebQSP SFT instance:")
print(webqsp_sft_data['train'][0]) # Show an example
```



#### 🚂 Training KG-TRACES Model

Just run `scripts/train.sh` easily: 

```bash
bash scripts/train.sh
```


#### 🧪 Inference

Just run `scripts/predict.sh` easily:

```bash
bash scripts/predict.sh
```


#### 🎁 Pretrained Models: Ready to Use!
Don't want to train from scratch? Grab our fine-tuned KG-TRACES models from the Hugging Face Model Hub: [KG-TRACES](https://huggingface.co/Edaizi/KG-TRACES)


``` python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

model_hub_name = "Edaizi/KG-TRACES"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_hub_name)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_hub_name)
```
